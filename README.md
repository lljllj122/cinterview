C-Interview
-----------

Most of the codes are from or based on Learn C The Hard Way, including DArray, Hashmap, Queue, Stack, BST, Linked List, Ring Buffer and so on. Thanks this great book and its author!

I added Heap, Threaded binary tree and Trie tree. I may detail them later.

Two BSearch algorithms are provided, one of them is similar to the bsearch function in C.

Still missing: Sorting algorithms, Ring Buffer (Unfinished), Graph and Tree algorithms (i.e. DFS, BFS), KSelect Algorithm and so on.

I may add other data structures and useful algorithms, maybe like some string algorithms.
